Installing Rgraphviz
====================

Windows

Oct 30, 2007

Here are the steps to build Rgraphviz on Windows:

o. make sure your MSVCR80.DLL is from Microsoft Visual C++ 2005 SP1 
   Redistributable Package 
   http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=200B2FD9-AE1A-4A14-984D-389C36F85647&displaylang=en

o. install graphviz ***2.15*** Windows ***binary*** distribution from
      http://www.graphviz.org/Download_windows.php
   , say, in dir $DIR.  We use the following as an example:
         C:\R-tools\graphviz-2.15
   .  If you install it in other dir, just use your dir correspondingly.

o. set the following Windows environment variables accordingly
   (control panel -> systems -> Advanced -> Environment Variables ):
   (a) create new user variables:
     GRAPHVIZ_INSTALL_DIR   (e.g., C:\/R-tools\/graphviz-2.15)
     GRAPHVIZ_INSTALL_MAJOR (e.g., 2)
     GRAPHVIZ_INSTALL_MINOR (e.g., 15)

     Notice the way "\/" are used for the paths above.

   (b) add to user variable 'path': $GRAPHVIZ_INSTALL_DIR/bin
     e.g., C:\R-tools\graphviz-2.15\bin

o. run "R CMD INSTALL ...Rgraphviz" as usual

o. when running R, do the following in THE FOLLOWING order:
    > ...make sure NO library("graph") is loaded...
    > dyn.load("c:/R-tools/graphviz-2.15/bin/gvc.dll")
    > library("Rgraphviz")
    > ...operate as normal...
   The point is to explicitly load in graphviz/bin/gvc.dll.
   This is to work around an issue related to libs name conflicts.

Source based installation
=========================

The Rgraphviz package depends on the Graphviz library which can be
obtained from http://www.graphviz.org/.

At present, Rgraphviz is known to work with Graphviz versions greater
than or equal to 2.2 (note however that a bug in the neato layout
routine makes it preferable not to use versions 2.4, 2.6 and 2.8)

To install Graphviz:

 1. Download the source tarball from http://www.graphviz.org/
 2. Unpack the distribution (tar -xzvf)
 3. Read the Graphviz installation instructions.  Basically, you
    should be able to do:

      ./configure
      make
      make install

A word of warning, especially on the Mac OS X platform: Rgraphviz may
not work if Graphviz is compiled with optimization.

For the most recent version of Graphviz, you will also need to make
sure that pkg-config (http://pkgconfig.freedesktop.org/wiki/) is
installed on your system.  If you install Graphviz to a non-standard
location, you may need to set the PKG_CONFIG_PATH environment variable
to tell pkg-config where the Graphviz metadata lives.  Here is an example:

    export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/home/me/graphviz/lib/pkgconfig

At this point you should be able to install Rgraphviz either via R CMD
INSTALL or by starting R and using install.packages.

Note that older versions of Graphviz use a configure script called
dotneato-config which must be in your PATH for Rgraphviz to find it.
This is instead of the pkg-config setup.
